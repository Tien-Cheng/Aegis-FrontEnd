Putting our expertise to good use, we developed a state of the art A.I. system to detect, and even report track faults. By deploying a series of charging stations, and tracking beacons, the drones could operate 24/7, operating without the need for constant supervision. Our drones helped improve the efficiency of Singapore's metro system, reducing the occurrences of train breakdowns, ultimately benefiting thousands of commuters."
